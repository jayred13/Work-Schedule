This is an online schedule retrieval bot based around Python automation for my fellow Costco employees.
*** DISCLAIMER: The program will not take into consideration of schedule updates. Once a workday is retrieved,
it will keep it. Any changes to that workday are not yet taken into consideration.****

What will be needed for a successful (alpha-build) retrival:
  1) Valid Costco employee credentials
  
  2) Google calendar ID
    - Can be located by following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0m5JSNX8qQ
  
  3) Google Developer API credentials
    - Follow this process: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
    - Keep 'credentials.json' file with all the other files.
  
  4) Lastly, chromedriver.exe may need to be re-downloaded.
    - Available here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
    - Select the one that best fits your computer.


****************************************************************************************

Plans for future builds:
- Background running of application.
- Secure credentials saving so input will only be needed upon first time use. 
- Most recent workday updated consideration.
- Multiple browser incorporations.
- Multiple calendar incorporations.
- Automation to other sections of the employee portal.
- Fix StaleElement Bug
- Moblie or Chrome Extension?
